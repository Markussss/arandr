* add option to make layout default on startup by means of desktop environment integration
* implement missing xrandr 1.2 features: reflect, additional modes (for forcibly applying saved layouts so they are already active when an output is connected), fb, fbmm/dpi
* call xrandr without blocking
* receive notifications on changes (XRRScreenChangeNotify)

    * useful resources: <http://www.mail-archive.com/sawfish-list@gnome.org/msg03630.html> (a patch to sawfish for xrandr event support), Xrandr.c (that defines XRRSelectInput), SelInput.c (compare XSelectInput /XRRSelectInput), ./eventdemo.py

* don't reset displays moved over edges; instead, move as far as possible
* allow setting dpi
* integrate related settings: (might end up writing a complete configuration manager, which is not my intention)

    * xsetwacom
    * gnome-panel layout (is this 1.3's --primary?)

* integrate new 1.3 features (projection matrix, panning (requested in <http://forum.eee-pc.de/viewtopic.php?t=8035>))
* be more intelligent about future xrandr versions (cf debian #523903)
* read --props, parse edid (using parse-edid from read-edid), maybe even offer setting properties
* make script properties editable (and explain what it does)
* provide example scripts

    * for rotation
    * for setting background images?

* have inactive outpus in a side bar, showing their size?
* gracefully handle

    * loading files describing invalid state
    * naming transitions (LVDS -> LVDS1)
    * unimplemented options (--right-of)
