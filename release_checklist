checklist before release:

 * after next release, ditch old svn, install redirect and notify maintainers

 * in branch master, set version in `setup.py` and `screenlayout/gui.py`, and make sure the latest NEWS entry matches
 * update README for new file names (be sure to catch all)
 * commit as 'ready for release ...'
 * `git log --first-parent master > ChangeLog.new`
 * `git checkout release`
 * `git merge --no-ff master` (make sure files that should not be shipped in the tarball are not pulled)
 * `mv ChangeLog.new ChangeLog; git commit --amend -a` and set title to 'release ...'
 * `git tag $VERSION`
 * `git archive $VERSION | gzip -9 > ../arandr-$VERSION.tar.gz`
 * `pristine-tar commit ../arandr-$VERSION.tar.gz`
 * update website to reflect new README
 * push to gitorious
 * notify maintainers
