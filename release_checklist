checklist before release:

 * after next release, ditch old svn, install redirect and notify maintainers

 * in branch master, set version in `setup.py` and `screenlayout/gui.py`
 * update README for new file names (be sure to catch all)
 * `git checkout release`
 * `git merge --no-ff master` (make sure files that should not be shipped in the tarball are not pulled)
 * `git tag $VERSION`
 * `git archive $VERSION | gzip -9 > ../arandr-$VERSION.tar.gz`
 * `pristine-tar commit ../arandr-$VERSION.tar.gz`
 * update website to reflect new README
 * push to gitorious
 * notify maintainers
